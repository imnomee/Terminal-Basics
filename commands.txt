If you run only cat filename it will display file contents
if you use cat firstfile secondfile it will display both files content joined

Spaces betwen the words / arguments are consumed by the shell. so if you add 2 spaces. it will change to one.
if you want to keep the spaces you can use the quotes for the arugment to preserve the spaces.
