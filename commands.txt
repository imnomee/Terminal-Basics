Spaces betwen the words / arguments are consumed by the shell. so if you add 2 spaces. it will change to one.
if you want to keep the spaces you can use the quotes for the arugment to preserve the spaces.

you shouldn't use spaces in file names. as it will create problem accessing through terminal. or you will always have to access within quotes

ls -t will display list with created first order
cat -n will siplay the contents with lines number in start
